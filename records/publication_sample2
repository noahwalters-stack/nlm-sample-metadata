Abstract:
Walter, Fernandez, Snelling, and Barkus examine the association between family studies and genetic disorders associated with an expression of schizotypal
traits. They found that genetic proximity to schizophrenia also increases the presence of schizotypal traits, and that certain chromosomal regions are 
associated with schizotypy. The study began with the genes associated with schizophrenia as the start point, and then through further neurobiological
examination selected out other genes of interest. The conclusion was that further and narrower investigation was required.
