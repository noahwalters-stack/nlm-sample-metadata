Abstract:
Rudolph and Klein examine depressive personality (DP) disorder traits in youth, and the potential origins as well as consequences of these traits. A sample of
143 youth (with a mean age of 12.37 years, standard deviation of 1.26) completed interviews and questionnaires on two occasions with their caregivers,
separated by a period of 12 months. 
The results found that DP traits were associated with constructs including negative self-focus, high-negative and low-positive emotionality, and heightened
stress reactivity. Furthermore, origins of DP were identified, such as maternal depression and a history of family adversity. DP traits successfully
predicted the generation of stress and emergence of depression during the pubertal transition. Depression further predicted subsequent DP traits, reflecting
a reciprocal relationship between the two.
