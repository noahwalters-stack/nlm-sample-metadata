Abstract:
McGilchrist argues that our society is driven too much by our brains' left-hemisphere thinking, and that this has given way to a collective reality in which
we are unable to appreciate spirituality in our world. Thus, in covering a variety of subjects including philosophy and physics, he pushes for a synthesis 
of left and right hempishere thinking that will lift human society away from our current crises.
