# nlm-sample-metadata
This is a small project demonstrating my capability in creating metadata using the NLM classification system.

Text selection:
For this project, I selected two research publications and one book (these can be found in the records folder). I began with "The Matter With Things," of which I was already aware. Knowing the subject matter helped with classifying it. Next, I consulted the National Library of Medicine's PubMed engine to find two additional publications. I selected two that I personally considered interesting.

Classification process:
Next, I utilized the NLM's Classification 2025 Winter Edition to find schedules that aligned with the topics in my publications. Two of them fall under the
WM section, which relates to psychiatry, but one fell under the WS section due to its focus on adolescent psychiatry. In order to determine each NLM
classification, I reviewed the related MeSH terms and the summaries of all of the publications to figure which classification best represented the aims of
each work. I attached an abstract to each work that further justifies my classification choices.

I appreciate your review of this small sample project, I hope that you find this project has adequately demonstrated my capabilities and I look forward to hearing back from your organization.
